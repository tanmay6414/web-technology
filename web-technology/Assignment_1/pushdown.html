	<h1> Pushdown Automata </h1>
	<p> 
		Pushdown Automata is a finite automata with extra memory called stack which helps Pushdown automata to recognize Context Free Languages. A Pushdown Automata (PDA) can be defined as : Q is the set of states. ∑ is the set of input symbols. Γ is the set of pushdown symbols

		<li>Γ is the set of pushdown symbols (which can be pushed and popped from stack)</li>
